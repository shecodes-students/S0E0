Hi!
==

This is exciting! We are very happy to have you here. Thank you for being one of the very first beta testers of she.codes! We do appreciate your support a lot!
Should you have any questions or get stuck, you can always reach us at [beta@she.codes](mailto:beta@she.codes) or on Skype (Olena is `olena.levitsky` and Jan is `regularwork`).

Like ssen on TV!
----------------
The learning experience is partinioned like a TV show. There are _seasons_ and every season has _episodes_. You are currently looking at Season 0, Episode 0 (or S0E0 for short).
This season is not part of what future students will see, it is exclusively for you beta testers.
In this episode, we will get your personal journal set up, so you will be able to write about your learning experience.

Github
------
Because we want to get you up to speed as fast as possible, we do not use blogging software or a CMS or anything like that for the journal.
Instead, we through you right into the deep end â€“ you will use the free web serivce _Github_ for editing your text. This is the same web services you will use throughout
the whole learning experience and it is the same web service you will most likely use in your job later on.

If you don't know what Gitbub is, don't worry. You don't have to at all.

Reading Lists
-------------
Throughout the various episodes we will send you out to external web sites to pick up their free gems of wisdom.
In each episode we give you a list of links to visit, this list is called a _reading list_.

The bookmarklet is with you
---------------------------
At the top left corner of each reading list, you will find an indicator of the season and episode it belongs to (`S0E0` for this one).
This thing is called the _id_, so this episode's id is S0E0. The id is a link, but it is a very special link, one you should not click!
The id is linked to a little program, a _bookmarklet_. A bookmarklet is meant to be dragged into the browsers bookmark bar, that's usally below the input field for the address.
(at least in Chrome it is.)
So, go ahead and drag the S0E0 link of the reading list below into yur bookmakr bar.
There, you just installed the bookmarklet for this episode.

What the bookmarklet does
-------------------------
Basically, whenever you are on an external website studying their content, you can bring back the reading list by clicking on the beeokmarklet in the bookmark bar.
Like the location indicator in a tram, it shows you where you come from, where you currently are and where you go to next. More importantly,
it will show you our annotations, comments and hints for the page you are currently looking at!
That's why you should always make sure to click the bookmarklet after navigating to a new page on an external web site. We might have some valuable comment for you!
Simply make it a habit to click the bookmarklet whenever you do not see the reading list!

Ready?
------
Okay, so here is your first quest, your first reading list. Enjoy the ride!

Dear diary
----------
Knowing about how you feel while studying the material we
show to you, is very important to us. Please write down all the little confusiona, missunderstandinga or even frustrations you might encounter, but do not leave out the fun and exciting moments as well!

Should you encounter terms you do not understand, we leave it to your judgment whether you use Wikipedia or Google or anything else to search for a definition or explanation. If you find something that halped you, please take a note of the url in your journal.
If English is not your first language and you struggle with certain words, please consult an online dictionary and also take a note of it. We want she.codes to work for as much women as possible, so it is important to us, that the language is as accessible as possible.

If you get stuck and contact us, please also write about this incident in your journal.

So, probably it makes sense to keep your journal open at all times in a dedicated tab or window of your browser.
